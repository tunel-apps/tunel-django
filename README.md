# Tunel Django

> Django template for tunel apps.

**under development**

You might want to quickly deploy an application to show off your analysis, paper,
or even create a programmatic RestFul API for others to use and run on a high performance computing
cluster. You should not need to start from scratch to do this! Brought to you by [tunel](https://github.com/tunel-apps/tunel), this template templates will get you started with a solid base for your development.

This particular teplate will get you started to deploy a Django application
that deploys via a web socket (most likely to be supported by your center, and it's less common
that ports are available on compute nodes).
The template includes:

 - several branded themes to choose from
 - a basic user and registration model
 - a restful API example
 - several database options supported by Django (sqlite, postgres and mysql)
 - examples of testing for your code

## TODO

 - Add structured API
