# Filesystem Explorer

By default, tunel-django comes with support to browse the filesystem. If you need
to do this, the defaults can be changed to allow for more file types - see
[the docs here](https://django-filebrowser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).
The setup to run on the HPC cluster is managed by tunel, which has a custom argument
to specify a full path to where you want to bind to explore (defaults to $HOME).
